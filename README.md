# A simple library for encoding objects into an <b>ljson</b> string. <br>
It is like json, but L (!) json. Try it. <br>
The string contains only the object fields in the order specified by the user. <br>
To separate the fields, a separate symbol is used at the beginning of the word and a separate one at the end (they must be different). <br>
These characters are rare for human writing.
